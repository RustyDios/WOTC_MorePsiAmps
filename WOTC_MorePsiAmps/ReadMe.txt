[h1] What is it? [/h1]
This mod is a near copy of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1467502437] ObelixDK's No More Psi Amps [/url] with a few differences.
Made with permission from ObelixDK.

[h1] Changes: [/h1]
The major differences are as follows;
[list]
[*]A [b]NEW 'psi amp' [/b]has been created as a [b]'Psionic Implant'[/b]. These Psionic Implants do not replace the original psi amps. This means you can use 'psi amp' style animations alongside ObelixDK's amazing 'no amp' animations [b]!![/b]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1218007143] Playable Aliens Sectoid Psi Amps [/url] receives the 'no amp' animations, which should fix all kinds of issues as they previously had NO weapon animations at all! Also gets a weapon image face lift.
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1125004715] Biotic Class Psi Amp[/url] recieves new weapon images but retains the original archetype/models/animations.
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1138411890] Psionic Class [/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137913176] Necromancers [/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1783416494] Chaplain Class [/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1548578600] Reaper Cryptics [/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2151317748] Iconoclast [/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1722628042] BurnOut [/url] and [b] Vanilla Psi-Ops [/b] receives the new implants at squaddie loadout, instead of a standard Psi Amp.
[/list]

Each new Psionic Implant comes with images made by nelVlesis. Also updated the main Psionics Research image and the schematic images.

The new Psionic Implant should upgrade and evolve alongside the regular Psi Amp. They copy all the settings from regular Psi Amps, except for 'Number of Upgrade Slots'.
Vanilla psi amps have no upgrade slots, but for mod compatibility with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2222545926] Psionics Ex Machina 3.0 [/url] these 'Implant Amps' have been given the following values, editable in the config files;
[list]
[*]Conventional Tier = 0
[*]Magnetic Tier = 1
[*]Beam Tier = 3
[/list]
The new Psionic Implant are of the 'psiamp' weapon category and should work with all mods and classes that can use 'psiamps'. Biotic and Sectoid versions remain their own categories. The slot values are intentionally [i]less[/i] than 'external psi amps'.

I also make all psi-amp like weapons into Unique Equipment Categories, so no dual-psi type stuff should happen.

These are designed to be used on classes with Psionic Skill Trees that you want as 'natural' Psionics (and not GEM-gifted Psionics from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2222545926] Psionics Ex Machina 3.0 [/url] for example, the slots intended for skills the 'natural' class does not have). You will need another mod to view these slots, such as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1122974240] Robojumper's Squad Select [/url] OR [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1127491931] Mod Everything Reloaded [/url]

It's just [i]nice[/i] to have the option of what style to use. The lore for all three types of the Psionic Implants has been adjusted slightly to match.

[h1] Compatibility and Known Issues [/h1]
None that I know of. I even repacked a version of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1467502437] ObelixDK's No More Psi Amps [/url] upks so the mods shouldn't crash if used together.

I have merged the Biotic Schematics with Psionics Schematics so you only need to purchase one to upgrade them all. This can be turned off in the config file [i]XComGame.ini[/i].
To compensate for the merge I bumped the prices up a little for the Psionics Schematics. This can be adjusted in the config file [i]XComStrategyTuning[/i].

[h1] Credits and Thanks [/h1]
[b]HUGE THANKS[/b] to ObelixDK for the original animations from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1467502437] No More Psi Amps [/url]
Many thanks to nelVlesis for a) pushing me to make these changes and b) providing all the images and lore edits

To the XCOM2 Modders community and discord for being an amazing level of support.

~ Enjoy [b]!![/b] and please buy me a [url=https://www.buymeacoffee.com/RustyDios] Cuppa Tea [/url]
